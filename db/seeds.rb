# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

players = Player.create([{ name: "Mo"}, {name: "Guillermo"}])
Board.create(score: "100", player_id: Player.all.sample.id)
# Board.create(score: 100, player_id: Player.all.sample.id)
# Player.create(name: "Guillermo")
